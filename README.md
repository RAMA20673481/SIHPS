## Problem Title

SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations

## Problem Description

Background: Railway stations are complex environments with numerous facilities and locations such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often face difficulties in navigating these spaces, especially in large or unfamiliar stations. Efficient and user-friendly navigation systems are crucial for improving passenger experience, reducing congestion, and ensuring timely travel connections. Description: The problem involves developing a comprehensive navigation solution for railway stations that assists passengers in locating various facilities and destinations within the station premises. This includes creating detailed maps, providing real-time directions, and integrating features such as accessibility options for individuals with disabilities. The solution should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible via multiple platforms, including mobile devices and digital kiosks. Key challenges include updating navigation information in real-time, ensuring accuracy, and accommodating the diverse needs of all passengers. Expected Solution: The expected solution is a multi-platform navigation system that provides detailed, real-time directions to all facilities and locations within a railway station. This system should include: A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation. Digital kiosks located throughout the station with touch-screen interfaces. Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers. Regular updates to reflect changes in station layout and facility locations. Integration with existing railway apps and services for seamless user experience. The solution should enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing confusion, saving time, and improving accessibility within the station.

## Architecture Diagram

User Interface (UI) – Web and Mobile App for users to search facilities, view educational content, and track credits.

Geolocation Module – Detects the user's location and suggests nearby e-waste facilities.

Database – Stores facility information, device models, hazardous component data, and user credit points.

Educational Content Engine – Provides pop-ups and interactive material about e-waste hazards.

Incentive Module – Calculates credits based on device input and precious metal recovery.

Admin Panel – Facility managers and government bodies can update locations, campaigns, and educational resources.

## Use Cases

Locate Facility: User opens the app → system displays nearest e-waste collection points.

Learn about E-Waste: User clicks on a device type → pop-up shows harmful components and risks.

Earn Credits: User inputs old device model → system calculates potential credits based on precious metals.

Receive Notifications: User receives reminders about upcoming e-waste drives or campaigns.
